## **Description**
Our final project designed in godot to be a 2D turn combat style game with some fun mechanics.

Here is our two working submodules + the original source where we started all the way back in October/Early September, see below for the differences


### Naming Convention:
Corebelyn (Corebellyn?) - working "stable" version of the godot game implementation - headed by Colotn Coughlin & John Cordwell III

    Included in our stable release are some of the following features:
        - Working dictionaries and vectors/2D vectors. 
        - Function turn base manager
        - Smooth movements
        - Interactive buttons
        - Detailed Game world
        - Start Menus
        - Attack, Run, Defend Options
        - Party and Enemy Systems

Trames-Adventura - lots of theoretical work that either never fully integrated or got too ambitious for the project - headed by Isaac Abella

    Included in Trames-Adventura are some of the theoretical scripts
        - Procedural Generation for weapons, dictionary stats, and character classes
        - Abstract class creation for player characters
        - Custom vector sorts - (Superseded by turns manager used in Corebelyn)
        - Inventory System
        - Weapon System - (Simple attack feature favored instead)
        - Combat System 1.0 (Deeper combat logic)
        - Experience System
